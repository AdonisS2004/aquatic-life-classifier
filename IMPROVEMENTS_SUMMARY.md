# Aquatic Life Classifier - Performance Improvements

## Current Issues Identified

1. **Class Imbalance**: Significant imbalance in dataset
   - "Turtle_Tortoise": 1,332 samples
   - "Jelly Fish": 591 samples  
   - "Dolphin": 547 samples
   - Most classes: ~350 samples

2. **Model Architecture**: Shallow CNN with limited feature extraction
3. **Training Configuration**: Basic hyperparameters not optimized
4. **Data Augmentation**: Insufficient for underwater image variability

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Class Imbalance Handling**
- ✅ **Weighted Random Sampling**: Implemented `WeightedRandomSampler` to balance class distribution
- ✅ **Class Weight Calculation**: Automatic calculation based on class frequencies
- ✅ **Balanced Training**: Ensures all classes are represented equally during training

### 2. **Enhanced Model Architecture**
- ✅ **Residual Connections**: Added `ResidualBlock` for better gradient flow
- ✅ **Attention Mechanism**: Added attention layer to focus on important features
- ✅ **Deeper Network**: Increased network depth with residual blocks
- ✅ **Better Regularization**: Added BatchNorm1d in classifier layers
- ✅ **Improved Classifier**: More layers with better dropout strategy

### 3. **Advanced Training Techniques**
- ✅ **Mixup Augmentation**: Implemented mixup for better generalization
- ✅ **AdamW Optimizer**: Better weight decay implementation
- ✅ **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents gradient explosion
- ✅ **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with patience-based stopping
- ✅ **Improved Learning Rate Scheduling**: Better patience and factor settings

### 4. **Enhanced Data Augmentation**
- ✅ **Underwater-Specific Augmentation**: 
  - Increased rotation (30° vs 15°)
  - Vertical flips for upside-down creatures
  - Enhanced color jittering for underwater lighting
  - Random perspective distortion
  - Random erasing for occlusions
  - Grayscale augmentation

### 5. **Optimized Hyperparameters**
- ✅ **Reduced Batch Size**: 16 (from 32) for better gradient estimates
- ✅ **Lower Learning Rate**: 0.0001 (from 0.001) for stable training
- ✅ **Increased Epochs**: 150 (from 100) with early stopping
- ✅ **Better Weight Decay**: 0.0001 for regularization
- ✅ **Improved Scheduler**: Longer patience (10) and better factor (0.5)

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Validation Accuracy Target: 70-80% (up from ~50%)

**Key Factors Contributing to Improvement:**

1. **Class Balance**: Weighted sampling should improve performance on minority classes
2. **Residual Architecture**: Better feature extraction and gradient flow
3. **Attention Mechanism**: Focus on discriminative features
4. **Mixup Augmentation**: Better generalization and robustness
5. **Enhanced Augmentation**: More realistic training data variations
6. **Optimized Training**: Better convergence with improved hyperparameters

## Training Recommendations

1. **Monitor Class-wise Performance**: Check if all classes improve equally
2. **Visualize Attention Maps**: Understand what features the model focuses on
3. **Experiment with Learning Rates**: Try 0.0005 and 0.00005 as alternatives
4. **Consider Transfer Learning**: If accuracy plateaus, consider pre-trained models
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for final prediction

## Usage

The improved model can be trained using the existing pipeline:

```bash
python -m src
```

The training will automatically use all the improvements:
- Weighted sampling for class balance
- Enhanced data augmentation
- Residual architecture with attention
- Mixup augmentation
- Early stopping and improved scheduling

## Monitoring

Check the logs for:
- Class distribution information
- Training/validation accuracy progression
- Early stopping triggers
- Best model saves

The model should show significant improvement in validation accuracy, especially for previously underperforming classes.
